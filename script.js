// Mechanics of a pong game:
// - Paddles
//  - Move up and down
//  - Ball bounces off paddles
// - Ball
//  - Bounces off everything, normally in a diagonal manner
//  - Start of game, ball gets sent in a random direction
//  - After a point is scored, send ball to non-scoring player
// - Score
//  - Increments up 1 each time ball passes edge of screen

// What other game elements should I consider?
// Start game/restart game buttons. This would be nice when playing with friends, so CHECK
// I don't think a leaderboard would be necessary. Correct, leaderboard unnecessary, so NIX
// No need to have a highscore setting. Correct, highscore unnecessary, so NIX
// I could work on having interchangeable backgrounds, that would be a good addition to this project that could help me in other projects. This might be difficult, but I'll try, so CHECK
