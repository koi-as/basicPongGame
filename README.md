# A Basic Pong Game

### By Alex Seidensticker

Basic Pong game using JavaScript. Move the paddle(s) and try and beat your friend (now life-long enemy)! I will be trying to build this from scratch with as little tutorial help as possible.

## My Additions

I expect to be adding theme changing as an additional feature. Instead of having a basic white or black background, have gradients or patterns appear on the canvas to make it more visually appealing or something.

The reason for this addition in particular was to test and apply to a different project sometime in the future. 

Another basic feature I want to add is a restart function that doesn't require refreshing the web page each time to play a new game. 

The last thing to consider is who the player will be playing against. I am thinking of having it default as a 2 player game and you can switch to vs Computer with a toggle, or vice versa. Score limit probably set to 7 or 11 depending on what I'm feeling like through development (I'll put final change here once I've decided).
